## Middle PHP / Senior JS Software Developer

I like to think in the context of business needs and resources to solve complex
tasks. Being a Technical Leader and working directly with the client I can
easily communicate with the different kind of people, help them and teach them.
As a C++ developer at the very beginning I have a good vision about programs'
internal representation and performance.

Besides work I often gain experience by reading someone else's code,
contributing to Open Source, experimenting with Webpack loaders, different
parsers, virtual DOM, reactivity, animations, developing frontend libraries and
backend framework. I have no hardcoded beliefs and always opened for
discussions.
